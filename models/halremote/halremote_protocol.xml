  The HAL Remote protocol can be used to remotely interact with a HAL
  instance.

  <message name = "halrcomp bind">
    This message binds a HAL remote component to a HAL instance. If
    the local description of the HAL component matches the remote
    description the bind will be confirmend. In case the remote
    instance does not exist prior to the bind request it will be
    automatically created.

    In case the remote instance of the component does not match the
    description sent with the bind message, the bind request will be
    rejected.

    The *no_create* flag can be used to prevent the Haltalk server
    from creating a new remote component instance in case none exists.

    The *halrcommand set* message is used to update pin values of

    a local description of the HAL configuration exists.

    The difference of this command to the *halrcomp set* command is,
    that this command operates on input pins as if they would be
    changed from outside whereas *halrcomp set* works on output pins
    as if they would be changed from inside the remote component.

    a *set reject* message will be returned.
