* Machinetalk code generator
  This code generator is based on [[https://github.com/imatix/gsl][imatix/gsl]] and generates code for
  Machinetalk protocol bindings. The idea is that protocol description
  resides in a single model from which documentation and different
  language bindings can be generated.

  Currently machinetalk-gsl supports following languages:
  - Python
  - Qt/C++
  - Node.js
  - Markdown and Graphviz

** Directory structure
   The project is organized in the following structure:
   - models: contains all protocol and channel models
   - scripts: contains scripts for the code generator
   - generated: here all the generated code is output
   - generate.sh: fires up the code generator

** Getting started
   - First install gsl by following these [[https://github.com/imatix/gsl#toc3-32][instructions]].
   - Then install graphviz ~sudo apt install graphviz~
   - Fire up ~sh generate.sh~

   You can use the =entr= tool to automatically trigger a new build
   when a model changes by issuing following command:
   ~ls models/* scripts/* | entr sh -c "sh generate.sh"~
